# Author: Chimara Okeke
# Language: SED script
# Code Description: This program uses simple regex-matching properties to detect whether an inputted phone number matches a specific format.
# If yes, the program outputs a randomized string of letters as a form of encrypting the inputter number.
# To run: This file is called "phone_encrypter.sed". You shall need another file of phone numbers called "phone.txt".
# In a terminal, such as Putty, type: sed -r -f phone_encrypter.sed phone.txt 
# The output is a list of the encrypted phone numbers.
